# project-two
The [comptia A](https://dussy42.github.io/project-two/) quiz was based on real comptia a+ exam questions and i particularly choose this because of my past experience in preparing for the comptia exam. However, potential user will have a feel of what real exam situation feels like, more like an exam simulation practise.

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) was used to validate the html while [jigsaw](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) was used for css , jshint for javascript and both turn out to be no error.While [wavereport](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://dussy42.github.io/project-two/) was also used to validate for errors and mostly color. I affrirm  upon using lighthouse in devtools that the website is accessibile with legible fonts and well lighted colors
